Q2.What is the Different Between Exception and error?
Answer:
Exception:
	Exceptions are Typically caused by issues that a program can potentially recover from such as incorrect user input ,file not found or network problems

	There are checked at compile time (Checked exceptions) or  Unchecked Exceptions (Run-time Exceptions)
Checked exceptions must be either caught using a try-catch block or declared in the method's throws clause.Examples of exceptions include IOException, NullPointerException,
 and ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.

Errors:
	Errors, on the other hand, represent severe and usually unrecoverable issues that typically indicate a problem at the system level or in the runtime environment.
	Errors are not meant to be caught or handled by typical application code because attempting to recover from them might lead to unpredictable behavior.
	Examples of errors include OutOfMemoryError, StackOverflowError, and VirtualMachineError.
